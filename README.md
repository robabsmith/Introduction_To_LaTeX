# Introduction_To_LaTeX

This site contains the introduction to using LaTeX written for the new Economics Students at Aalborg University. You download just the PDF with the information, or the zip file containing both the pdf and all of the files needed to produce the document (you will need to have some software installed that can render LaTeX documents to use these files). 

Best of luck!
