# Introduction_To_LaTeX

This site contains the introduction to using LaTeX written for the new Economics students at Aalborg University. Above, you can download either the PDF or the zip file containing both the pdf and all of the files needed to produce the document (you will need to have some software installed that can compile LaTeX documents to use these files). 

If you have any questions or comments you can contact me either via the mail in the PDF, or you can create an 'issue' in this site that I will respond to. 

Best of luck!
